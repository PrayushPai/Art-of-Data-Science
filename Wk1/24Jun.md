## Data Analysis as *Art*
 
 What this book deals with is like when we ask a musician what is really going in his mind would he be able to tell most of them, I guess not. Data Science is hard because of the fact that there are only a few _people who can explain it as beautifully as they can do it_.
 
 **Additional Reading**
 Donald Knuth's `Legendary Essay` [Computer Programming as an Art](http://www.paulgraham.com/knuth.html).
 
 He says `Science is knowledge which we understand so well that we can teach it to a computer. Everything else is ART`
 
 **Creative Spark:**
 At some point, the songwriter must inject a creative spark into the process to bring all the songwriting tools together to distinguish himself/herself
 _Statisticicians have a process that they espouse but do not fully understand_
 
#### What is Data Science
 1. Development of a useful framework involving characterisatoin of the elements of a data analysis using abstract language in order to find the commonalities across different kinds of analyses. _At times this language is the language of Mathematics._
 2. On the other hand is it the details of an analysis. <The analysis of an analysis>
